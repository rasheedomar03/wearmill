        <div style={sectionStyle}>
          <h2 style={headingStyle}>Orders and Quotes</h2>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            All pricing provided through our website or via email is an estimate until confirmed in a formal quote. Prices may vary based on final artwork, color count, garment availability, and order specifications. A confirmed quote is valid for 30 days from the date issued.
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            Orders are considered final once you approve the digital proof and confirm payment terms. After approval, changes to artwork, quantities, or product selection may incur additional charges or delay production.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div style={sectionStyle}>
          <h2 style={headingStyle}>Artwork and Proofs</h2>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            You are responsible for providing print-ready artwork or logo files. We offer a free digital proof for every order. It is your responsibility to review the proof carefully for spelling, colors, sizing, and placement before approving.
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            Once a proof is approved, Wearmill is not responsible for errors that were present in the approved proof. If we make an error that was not in the approved proof, we will reprint the affected items at no charge.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div style={sectionStyle}>
          <h2 style={headingStyle}>Production and Shipping</h2>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            Standard production time is 5 to 7 business days after proof approval. Rush orders (under 7 business days) are subject to a 15% surcharge and availability. Production timelines are estimates and not guaranteed delivery dates.
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            Orders over $500 qualify for free standard shipping. Shipping costs for smaller orders are calculated based on weight and destination. Wearmill is not responsible for delays caused by shipping carriers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div style={sectionStyle}>
          <h2 style={headingStyle}>Setup Fees</h2>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            Screen printing orders include a $25 setup fee per color, waived for orders of 144 units or more. Embroidery orders include a one-time $35 digitizing fee, waived for orders of 96 units or more. DTG (direct-to-garment) printing has no setup fee.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div style={sectionStyle}>
          <h2 style={headingStyle}>Returns and Reprints</h2>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            Custom printed products are made to order and cannot be returned for a refund unless there is a defect in materials or workmanship, or an error on our part that differs from the approved proof.
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            If you receive defective or incorrect items, contact us within 7 business days of delivery with photos of the issue. We will reprint the affected items or issue a credit at our discretion.
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            Minor variations in color between screen and printed output are inherent to the printing process and are not considered defects. Exact Pantone color matching is available for an additional $10 per color.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div style={sectionStyle}>
          <h2 style={headingStyle}>Payment</h2>
          <p style={paraStyle}>
            Payment terms are established at the time of order confirmation. For new customers, payment is due in full before production begins. Established accounts may qualify for net-30 terms at our discretion.
